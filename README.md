# GPS Database Overview

This website provides an visual overview of public data from [Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project](https://www.pneumogen.net/gps/) (GPS) that is available via [Monocle](https://monocle.sanger.ac.uk/login).

&nbsp;
## About the Website
The website takes the JSON file `data.json` generated by [GPS Database Processor](https://github.com/HarryHung/gps-database-processor) and renders the charts on the fly. The website utilises HTML5, JavaScript (vanilla JavaScript with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for chart rendering) to run fully on the client-side. This website has a responsive web design using a mixture of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout, but is not yet optimised for mobile devices.
